## Turn based strategy game

This is a turn based strategy game/template built in Godot. The game is a work in progress, with the end goal being a functional game that is also a good starting point for future projects.  The focus is on making new mechanics easy to implement and balance, and making the game easy to modify and expand.

### MVP
- [x] Simple 2D camera controls
- [x] Basic grid based movement
- [ ] Player actions (move, attack)
- [ ] Basic but expandable AI
- [ ] Basic UI (health, actions, etc)
- [ ] Basic map generation and/or loading
- [ ] Units with stats and abilities

### Future features
- [ ] Multiplayer, including pvp and co-op
- [ ] Slightly more advanced AI
- [ ] A larger set of abilities and mechanics
- [ ] More advanced map generation (procedural rather than just random)
- [ ] Replace placeholder art with simple but more polished art

### How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Godot 4.3
